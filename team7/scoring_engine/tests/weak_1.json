  "question": "Some people think universities should require students to take many general education courses. Others believe students should focus only on their major. What is your opinion?",
  "essay": "I think general education is good. Students need it. Major is also important but general is good too.\n\nStudents learn many things. It helps brain and thinking. Also life is not only job, it is knowledge. If students only study one subject they are boring people.\n\nAlso jobs need skills. General classes give skills. So it is useful. Universities should make rule.\n\nThat is why I agree."
