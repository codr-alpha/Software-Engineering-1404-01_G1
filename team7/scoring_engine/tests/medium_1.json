  "question": "Some people think universities should require students to take many general education courses. Others believe students should focus only on their major. What is your opinion?",
  "essay": "I agree that students should take general education classes. These classes are helpful for many reasons.\n\nFirst, students can learn different things. If they only study their major, they don’t know other knowledge. For example, science students can learn art and it makes them more creative. Also, these classes are interesting and not boring like major classes.\n\nAnother reason is jobs. In the future, jobs change, so students need many skills. General courses give skills. This is important for life.\n\nBut also, students are busy, and too many courses make stress. So universities should be careful.\n\nIn conclusion, general education is good and should be required."
