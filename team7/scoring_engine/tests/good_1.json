  "essay": "I think students should take some general education courses in addition to their major. Only studying one subject is not enough in modern society.\n\nOne reason is that general courses make students more knowledgeable. For example, if a business student studies history, they can understand how economic systems developed. This can give them a better understanding of global markets. Also, communication classes help students work better with other people.\n\nAnother reason is that students sometimes change their career plans. If they only studied one subject, it could be difficult to change. General education gives them more choices in the future.\n\nHowever, universities should not require too many general courses because students need time to focus on their main subject. The number should be limited.\n\nIn conclusion, general education is useful, but it should not replace major studies."
