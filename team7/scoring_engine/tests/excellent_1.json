  "question": "Some people think universities should require students to take many general education courses. Others believe students should focus only on their major. What is your opinion?",
  "essay": "I strongly believe that university students should take a combination of major courses and general education classes. While specialization is important for career preparation, exposure to other fields develops critical thinking and adaptability.\n\nFirst, general education courses help students understand the world from multiple perspectives. For instance, an engineering student who studies philosophy or sociology may better understand ethical issues and the social impact of technology. This broader awareness can prevent narrow thinking and improve decision-making in professional contexts.\n\nSecond, the modern job market changes rapidly, and people often switch careers. Students who only study their major might lack transferable skills. Courses in writing, communication, or psychology help students develop abilities that apply across many professions. Therefore, general education increases long-term flexibility.\n\nHowever, I agree that major courses should remain the core focus. The goal is balance, not overload. Universities should design programs where general education supports, rather than distracts from, specialization.\n\nOverall, a mixed curriculum produces not only skilled professionals but also informed and adaptable individuals."
